# Rust BSP for the Vorago REB1 development board

This is the Rust **B**oard **S**upport **P**ackage crate for the Vorago REB1 development board.
Its aim is to provide drivers for the board features of the REB1 board

The BSP builds on top of the [HAL crate for VA108xx devices](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/va108xx-rs/src/branch/main/va108xx-hal).
The example folder contains some example applications using the on-board peripherals.
